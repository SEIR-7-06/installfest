# Installfest for Windows, Step 2: Developer Tools

## Text Editor
Please use [Atom](http://atom.io) as your text editor. Install as normal for Windows.

Once you have finished installing and Atom has opened, close your command prompt and open a new one. At the new prompt, run `atom .` to ensure that your shell is correctly linked with the app.

## Browser
Our class will be using Chrome as our preferred browser. If you don't already have it, please follow [the installation instructions for Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en).

We also recommend you install the following Chrome Extensions:

* [JSON View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)
* [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/)

### Touch Typing
You will be at a serious disadvantage if you do not know how to touch type. To practice this skill we recommend [typingclub](http://typingclub.com), [speedcoder](http://www.speedcoder.net/) or [typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/).

### A word on *Keyboard Shortcuts*

By the way, developers LOVE shortcut key combinations. The more shortcuts you know, the faster you can code!

For starters, you should know how to `copy`, `paste`, and `cut`. But there are tons more [Mac Shortcuts](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mac+keyboard+shortcuts&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1) you should learn [how to read](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) and use!

Every single application above has its own list of shortcuts too!

Now that your environment is set up, let's get you the specific technologies we'll use in this course!
1. Set up your **Development Environment**:
    * [x] The BASH Command Line
    * [x] Developer Tools
2. Set up your **Web Technologies**:
    * [ ] [Node Stack](node-setup.md)
    * [ ] [Ruby on Rails Stack](ror-setup.md)

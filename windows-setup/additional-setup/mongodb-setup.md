# MongoDB Setup Instructions

MongoDB is non-relational database software that we'll use a few weeks from now when we start investigating backend web development. To prepare for that in advance we'll need you to walkthrough the installation instructions here:[MongoDB Windows Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).

If you run into any problems along the way, flag down an instructor and we'll do our best to troubleshoot with you!

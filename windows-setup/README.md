# Installfest for Windows: Welcome to the Party

Please note that your instructors all use Mac computers, and will be less able to help with troubleshooting for Windows computers. *If you are using a Windows computer for this course, you will likely face installation problems that your Mac-using classmates will not. It will be your responsibility to solve these problems, although they should all be solvable.*

With that out of the way, let's get started!

1. Set up your **Development Environment**:
    * [ ] [The BASH Command Line](bash-setup.md)
    * [ ] [Developer Tools](developer-tools.md)
2. Set up your **Web Technologies**:
    * [ ] [Node Stack](node-setup.md)
    * [ ] [Ruby on Rails Stack](ror-setup.md)

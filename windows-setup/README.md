# Installfest for Windows: Welcome to the Party

## WARNING: These instructions will lead to an unstable setup.
The Windows Subsystem for Linux is an unstable system, and has many bugs that will make your life more difficult for using it. If you are comfortable setting up Ubuntu in a VM (like using VirtualBox), that will be a better setup for you.

## To repeat: DO NOT follow these instructions unless you have no other option, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux is out of beta.

Please note that your instructors all use Mac computers, and will be less able to help with troubleshooting for Windows computers. *If you are using a Windows computer for this course, you will likely face installation problems that your Mac-using classmates will not. It will be your responsibility to solve these problems, although they should all be solvable.*

With that out of the way, let's get started!

1. Set up your **Development Environment**:
    * [ ] [The BASH Command Line](bash-setup.md)
    * [ ] [Developer Tools](developer-tools.md)
2. Set up your **Web Technologies**:
    * [ ] [Node Stack](node-setup.md)
    * [ ] [Ruby on Rails Stack](ror-setup.md)

# Installfest Step 1.1: Node.js & Express Stack

Most of the coding work we do in weeks 3 to 5 will be driven by the back-end web development framework [Express](http://expressjs.com). We'll install Express individually in each project we create. For now, we'll install the other tools we'll use along with Express.

#### Plan Overview

1. Install Node.js, a platform for back-end web development with the JavaScript programming language.
1. Install MongoDB, the database we'll use with our Node.js and Express stack.

## Node.js

__Note:  when copying the code snippets, please exclude the `$` as you paste and run the code into your terminal.  The dollar sign `$` is simply an indicator of the logged-in user's terminal prompt in the examples.__

1. Install Node.js with Homebrew by running the following command in the Terminal:

  ```bash
  $ brew install node
  ```

2. Run the Terminal command `node -v` to check that Node.js was installed. It should print a version number greater than or equal to "v5.8.0". The Terminal command `node` changes your Terminal into a Javascript REPL ("Read Evaluate Print Loop"), like the right-hand side of repl.it. Use the shortcut `ctrl + c`, or type `.exit` to quit out of the REPL and return to the normal Terminal prompt.

2. Run the Terminal command `which npm` to check that NPM is installed. The Node Package Manager, used through various `npm` commands, is a lot like Homebrew, except we'll use it for Node.js-specific tools instead of for general Mac tools. NPM packages are often called "node modules."

### Nodemon

Nodemon (short for "node monitor") will make our Node.js workflow more efficient.

1. Install nodemon globally with the following Terminal command:

  ```bash
  $  npm install -g nodemon
  ```


## MongoDB

MonogDB is a database that stores information as easy to read "documents". We'll use it to store data in our Node.js and Express stack.

1. Use Homebrew to update all our brew packages.

  ```bash
  $ brew update
  ```

2. Run `brew install` for **MongoDB**.

  ```bash
  $ brew install mongodb
  ```

3. Then we'll need a directory for **MongoDB** to save data. Make sure you create this directory inside your root (`/`) directory.

  ```bash
  $ cd /
  $ sudo mkdir -p data/db
  ```

  You will be prompted to enter your system password here. This is the password you use to log into your computer.

  *Sidenote:
  When you use this  `sudo` command, you are saying "superuser do" which can force your computer to perform the command you entered, even if it's a bad idea. This is why you're prompted to insert a password. Terminal makes sure your computer is secure and that you're sure about the command you're about to execute forcefully.*

4. Finally we'll want to make sure we have permission to read and write to this directory.

  ```bash
  $ sudo chown -R $USER data/db
  ```
  Again, you'll need to enter your system password.

5. Run two commands to check whether the install worked. You should see a file path after each command.

  ```bash
  $ which mongod
  $ which mongo
  ```

  If this has worked correctly, you will see `/usr/local/bin/mongod` and `/usr/local/bin/mongo` respectively as the outputs from terminal.

## RoboMongo

RoboMongo is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) tool to let us see the data in our Mongo databases.  Let's install that now.

1. Go to [https://robomongo.org/download](https://robomongo.org/download) and download the free (community) edition.
2. Install it!

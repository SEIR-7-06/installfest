# Installfest Step 2: Mac Development Tools & Applications

## Text Editor

Our class will begin the course with [Visual Studio Code](./editor-vsc.md) as our preferred text editor.

If you are using a Mac with an M1 chip you may need to run this command in your terminal.
```bash
cat << EOF >> ~/.zprofile
# Add Visual Studio Code (code)
export PATH="\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
EOF
```



## Browser
Our class will be using Chrome as our preferred browser. If you don't already have it, please follow the installation instructions for:

* [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en)

We also recommend you install the following Chrome Extensions:

* [JSON View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)


## Postman

Postman is a tool used for interacting with HTTP APIs. For basic HTTP "GET" requests, you could use your browser, but Postman allows you tailor your request to make POST requests, modify header information, format request bodies, and more. Postman will act as our client to send requests to the server and get a response back to test the APIs.

Download the Postman app [here](https://www.getpostman.com/products), making sure to get **the app and not the Chrome extension**. (Postman Chrome is deprecated and missing essential Postman features.) 

Postman has many features that you'll learn more about as we progress, so we won't spend too much time here.

An alternative some instructors use is [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/download/)

## Window Manager

While programming we'll often have many applications open on our desktop at a time. A window management tool can be a big help in moving these applications around your desktop. One we recommend is [spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/).

[Here is a list of helpful shortcut keys for Spectacle.](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle)

## Touch Typing
If you find you are a slow typer we highly recommend practicing your typing. Improving your typing will be a huge help in being able to follow along with the code-along activities and in your own work. To practice this skill we recommend [typingclub](http://typingclub.com), [speedcoder](http://www.speedcoder.net/) or [typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/).

## Keyboard Shortcuts
By the way, developers LOVE shortcut key combinations. The more shortcuts you know, the faster you can code!

For starters, you should know how to `copy`, `paste`, and `cut`. But there are tons more [Mac Shortcuts](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mac+keyboard+shortcuts&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1) you should learn [how to read](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) and use!

Every single application above has its own list of shortcuts too!

One way to learn them is to use this free plugin, CheatSheet, that makes it easy to see all possible shortcuts in whatever application you're currently using. Download and install [CheatSheet](https://mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/?lang=en) to get this tool. Once installed, press and hold the Command key and cheatsheet will pop up on its own.

> This is what CheatSheet looks like in action!

One of the best ways to learn keyboard shortcuts is to _STOP USING YOUR MOUSE_. Cover it with a piece of paper! Tape a list of shortcuts next to your screen!

## That's it!

# Installfest Step 2: Mac Development Tools & Applications

## Text Editor

Our class will begin the course with [Sublime Text 3](./editor-sublime-text-3.md) and eventually transition to [Visual Studio Code](./editor-vsc.md) as our preferred text editor. Install Sublime Text now.


## Browser
Our class will be using Chrome as our preferred browser. If you don't already have it, please follow the installation instructions for:

* [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en)

We also recommend you install the following Chrome Extensions:

* [JSON View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc)


## Postman

Postman is a tool used for interacting with HTTP APIs. For basic HTTP "GET" requests, you could use your browser, but Postman allows you tailor your request to make POST requests, modify header information, format request bodies, and more. Postman will act as our client to send requests to the server and get a response back to test the APIs.

Download the Postman app [here](https://www.getpostman.com/products), making sure to get **the app and not the Chrome extension**. (Postman Chrome is deprecated and missing essential Postman features.) 

Postman has many features that you'll learn more about as we progress, so we won't spend too much time here.

## Window Manager

While programming it's pretty common to need to juggle the placement of multiple windows. To speed up this process, we'll install a program that does this for us (and gives us a bunch of convenient keyboard shortcuts).

1. Download https://raw.github.com/onsi/ShiftIt/master/ShiftIt.zip
    * Next, extract it and drag the application icon into your `Applications` directory.
    * Finally, launch the app by right-clicking on the ShiftIt icon and click open, follow the instructions to enable the accessibility options.

2. We recommend you familiarze yourself with ShiftIt commands and keyboard shortcuts, like:
* Move window to the left-half: Command+Option+Control+LeftArrow
* Move window to the right-half: Command+Option+Control+RightArrow
* **M**aximize a window: Command+Option+Control+**M**

You can try this now.

## Touch Typing
You will be at a serious disadvantage if you do not know how to touch type. To practice this skill we recommend [typingclub](http://typingclub.com), [speedcoder](http://www.speedcoder.net/) or [typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/).

## Keyboard Shortcuts
By the way, developers LOVE shortcut key combinations. The more shortcuts you know, the faster you can code!

For starters, you should know how to `copy`, `paste`, and `cut`. But there are tons more [Mac Shortcuts](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mac+keyboard+shortcuts&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1) you should learn [how to read](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) and use!

Every single application above has its own list of shortcuts too!

One way to learn them is to use this free plugin, CheatSheet, that makes it easy to see all possible shortcuts in whatever application you're currently using. Download and install [CheatSheet](https://mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/?lang=en) to get this tool. Once installed, press and hold the Command key and cheatsheet will pop up on its own.

One of the best ways to learn keyboard shortcuts is to _STOP USING YOUR MOUSE_. Cover it with a piece of paper! Tape a list of shortcuts next to your screen!

## That's it!

## Sublime Text Editor

1. Use this link to [download Sublime Text 3](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203083.dmg).

### Configure Tab Size
We encourage you to set your tab size to 2 spaces:

1. In the menu bar, click: `Sublime Text 3` > `Preferences` > `Settings - User`
2. Replace the existing text with the following configuration options:

    ```json
    {
        "tab_size": 2,
        "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
    }
    ```

### Open Sublime from the Terminal

Sublime Text 3 includes a program that launches Sublime from the Terminal. We'll use the `ln` command to link that program to a simple `subl` command.

**Before following these steps**, make sure you downloaded Sublime Text 3, NOT Sublime Text 2. Also make sure you're running Sublime from your Applications folder NOT from the installer (go ahead and eject the installer if you haven't already).

1. To run a program from the Terminal, it needs to be available on your $PATH. The next step assumes `/usr/local/bin` is in your $PATH, so let's check that.  Run the following command from the Terminal to see your current $PATH:

    ```bash
    echo $PATH
    ```

2. Run the following command in your Terminal to set up the link:

    ```bash
    ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
    ```

3. Type `subl .` in the Terminal, and Sublime Text 3 should open!

### Configure Git to Use Sublime

When you forget to enter a commit message in the Terminal, git opens a text editor and reminds you to add a commit message.

1. Run the following command in the Terminal to configure git to open Sublime Text instead of the default text editor:

    ```bash
    git config --global core.editor "subl -w"
    ```
